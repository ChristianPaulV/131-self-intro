Hi, You can call me Chris! I am a BAMS Senior with a special interest in storytelling centered on [[20250216230007|love]], [[20250216230010|horror]], and the [[20250216230009|human experience]]. I dabble with every tool related to digital multimedia but my first love has always been working on my [[20250216224416|writings]].

Building [[20250216230001|personal knowledge management systems (PKM)]] has been a hobby, turned career, of mine for the last few years. My work as a writer of many things necessitated the need for a specialized system for curating my thoughts and generating new knowledge. 

My favorite knowledge mapping method and my preferred visualization of anything related to data are [[20250216230003|node-based systems]], which is what you're seeing here now.

I look forward to learning more about knowledge management in MMS 131 with you all for the coming weeks. I hope you enjoy this very-little [[20250216230001|pkm]] that I did!:] ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
