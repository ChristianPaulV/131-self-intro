A significant portion of Robredo's supporters are consumers of the 'Leni' brand. They value the label of being a 'Kakampink' more than being a participant in the democratic process.  

It's evident that by simply scrolling down on a social media of choice, we can both see that the campaign period of the presidential candidates had turned into a civil conflict: An us vs them between Kakampinks and BBM supporters (for simplicity, and not discounting those who would vote for other candidates.)  

Voting for Robredo has been marketed as a sign of intelligence and good character. Often her supporters ask the same question, albeit with variation:  
  
"napakita ko na yung detalyadong plataporma, track record, at academic achievements ni Leni, bakit si Marcos pa din iboboto mo?"  
  
This question usually remains unanswered and is often employed by a Kakampink to rhetorically say "bobo ka ba?"  
  
Kakampinks would also correctly present their well-rounded posts with complete references, but they would also take screenshots or share images of posts that make fun of BBM supporters' TikTok resources—a display of being intellectually elite. Ironically, this is intellectual arrogance at its highest form (i.e. do not underestimate the persuasive strength of short, easier-to-access, and easier-to-swallow TikToks, the platform can be used to our advantage).  
  
Taken from Gache's Article on the Elitism of the Robredo Campaign:  
"They (Robredo's supporters) loudly (and rightly) decry the historical denialism around Martial Law, without acknowledging that many registered voters have never been in a history class to learn about it. They publish lengthy infographics of Robredo’s accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook, without acknowledging that many registered voters have no Internet access. They keep pointing out the atrocities of the Marcos regime, without acknowledging that many voters have similar resentment for the regime that followed it. (Robredo, after all, even as she runs independently, is still chair of the Liberal Party.)  
  
To these people, anyone who supports Marcos cannot be disillusioned; anyone voting against Robredo cannot possibly be grounded in reality. They can only be delusional, stupid, or worse, evil."

...  
  
We do not need to defend any political candidate like a fandom defending their brand. Let's not encourage emotionally-charged rants (with a thin veil of being an "intellectual post") against fellow voters, because the winning president and its rule of law will affect the lives of all—especially, those at the grassroots level.  
  
Of course, there's no denying the existence of *those in power* who *deliberately* spread fake information and even worse, use underhanded political practices. A firm bearing should always be taken against them, in the ways one may think that is right.  
  
But for an individual BBM supporter, the only way we can properly "respect their opinion", is to not let it be, but to subject it in the eyes of Truth and argue on the grounds of empathy and care for our fellow Pilipino.
